# ADR-0001: GraphQL Schema Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The BGG GraphQL Proxy needs to provide a clean, intuitive API for accessing BoardGameGeek data. The schema should be designed to be developer-friendly while efficiently serving the most common use cases.

## Decision
We will design a GraphQL schema that:

- Uses generated types from the GraphQL schema definition
- Provides clear, descriptive field names in camelCase
- Includes proper type definitions for all BGG entities
- Supports common query patterns for board games, users, and collections
- Uses appropriate scalar types (ID, String, Int, Float, Boolean)
- Implements proper nullable/non-nullable field design

## Consequences

### Positive
- Type safety with generated TypeScript types
- Clear API contract for consumers
- Efficient data fetching with GraphQL queries
- Automatic documentation generation

### Negative
- Schema changes require code generation
- Learning curve for GraphQL newcomers
